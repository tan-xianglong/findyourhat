## What did you like about this project?

The project itself is fun as I can create a game. It allows me to test my JS knowledge and I'm glad I can do it and improvise it.

## What did you struggle with in this project?

I didn't find myself struggling. But I enjoy the process of polishing it to improve user experience.


## What would make your experience with this assessment better?

I appreciate the help to set up the game and I learned how to run a module using npm and node.js. Pretty cool.

I wish there is some object manipulation requirement. If more time is given, I might do up player object to store highscore for multiple players.
